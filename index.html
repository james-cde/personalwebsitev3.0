                <h3>hackBCA</h3>
                <p>I am currently one of the directors at hackBCA, a premier high school hackathon that occurs once a year at my school. My responsibilities include the livestream, coordinating with the school tech department for internet and power, as well as getting sponsors. This year, we are going in a new direction with Imagine 2018, a hackBCA event. Imagine will be a two day conference style workshop event that puts more of a focus on our mission, education.</p>

                <h3>Water Conservation System</h3>
                <p>The water conservation system is an undersink device used to detect and stop the flow of water. This not only conserves water but can stop a sink from overflowing, causing damage to the home if left running accidentally. The WCS was developed in the Mechatronics Research Lab at The Bergen County Academies and won two awards at the North Jersey Regional Science Fair as well as being a winner of the North Jersey Steam Tank Competition.</p>

                <h3>The 8-Bit Processor Project</h3>
                <p>The 8 Bit-Processor Project is a physical version of an 8 bit processor created on breadboards that I created after reading materials from a professor at Redeemer College, my computer science teacher, and Ben Eater's 8-Bit processor. Currently, I am designing a subset of the 6502 processor as an extension to this project, which will be used as a curriculum for an elective at my school.</p>
