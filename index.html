                <h3>BrightLogic Intern</h3>
                <p>Between March of 2017 and December of 2018, I was a Software Engineering Intern at BrightLogic, Inc., a company that specializes in interactive LED floors as well as mobile application development. At BrightLogic, I worked on projects that ranged from cross-platform Mobile Application Development for the service industry to floor sensor data visualization.</p>

                <h3>The 8-Bit Processor Project</h3>
                <p>The 8 Bit-Processor Project is a physical version of an 8 bit processor created on breadboards that I created after reading materials from a professor at Redeemer College, my high-school computer science teacher, and Ben Eater's 8-Bit processor. During my senior year of High School, I designed a subset of the 6502 processor as an extension to this project, which will be used as a curriculum for the Processors II course at my high school, where students build a processor at the circuit level. The project included building a physical model of the original 8-bit processor to understand each component at the physical circuit level, which is pictured at right.</p>

                <h3>Water Conservation System</h3>
                <p>The Water Conservation System is an undersink device used to detect and stop the flow of water. This not only conserves water but can stop a sink from overflowing, causing damage to the home if left running accidentally. The WCS was developed in the Mechatronics Research Lab at The Bergen County Academies and won two awards at the North Jersey Regional Science Fair as well as being a winner of the North Jersey Steam Tank Competition. The WCS also won 3rd place in Engineering out of 40 projects at BCA Expo, an ISEF affiliated science fair.</p>
